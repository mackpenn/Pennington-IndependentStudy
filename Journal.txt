Technical Journal - CSC 490
Thursdays 3pm-4pm with Dr. Ngo

----------------------------------------------------------

Friday, December 7th:
-Final planning meeting with Dr. Ngo
  -Set goals and expectation to work towards to
-GitHub repository created

Thursday, January 24th:
-Project start

Thursday, January 31st:
-Examined similar projects and set up Anaconda/Python 3
-Laid out GUI format for mouse/keyboard recording, goal is to have a base on 2/7

Sunday, February 3rd:
-Started creating interface using TKinter library for Python
-Created table layout and buttons, currently the buttons have no function
-Notes: Adjusting from Java to Python is definitely a challenge for me, but I am enjoying it. Luckily, the TKinter library is very similar to the ReactJS Material-UI library I used at my internship over the summer.

Tuesday, February 5th:
-Began practicing with the button functionality, followed some online tutorials for simple changes such as configuring the labels
-Worked mainly on actual button functionality afterwards

Wednesday, February 6th:
-Created Treeview table with tkinter in GUI window
-Issues:
  -Button widgets cannot be embedded within Treeview widgets.
-To-Do:
  -Make tree insertion work together with record
  -Add functionality to clear, record, and save buttons
-Ideas for later in project:
  -Add file menu widget to be able to load previous recordings
  -Treeview allows for items to be selected - maybe be able to tab through mouse recordings?
  
Thursday, February 7th:
-Pre-meeting: Tried to find workaround for using buttons and treeview at the same time
-Ideas: Could go back to using grid instead of treeview, but might not be as efficient?

Monday, February 11th:
-Now using PyQt5 for interface
-Created tables and buttons Clear, Record, and Stop
-Need to adjust window size
-Testing populating table with data, not working yet

Thursday, February 14th:
-Table populating with strings, but not with list items
-After meeting, assigned task to begin mouse recording step

Thursday, February 21st:
-Meeting cancelled this week

Friday, February 22nd:
-Experimenting with pyautogui, functionality to control mouse and keyboard but not record?
-Researching other mouse recording methods, found Pynput (https://pypi.org/project/pynput/)

Tuesday, February 26th:
-Added mouse listener/monitor
-Recording occurs without error but doesn't populate the data table, just the console
-Recording happens on file execution, not on button press
-Added stop button, but the buttons don't seem to control the recording
-When running file, the recording begins, and the window pops up only after clicking once. Clicking the buttons does not do much
